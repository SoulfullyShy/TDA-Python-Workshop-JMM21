# TDA-Python-Workshop-JMM21

This repository includes the jupyter notebooks for the 2021 Workshop "Mathematical and Computational Methods for Complex Social Systems" to be held at the virtual JMM 2021, led by [Elizabeth Munch](http://elizabethmunch.com/). This introduction is tailored for a network science audience, so the focus is on an relevant tools when given a network input.

The goals of this 1-hour introduction are:

- Give a brief overview of available packages
- Provide pipelines for computing persistent homology and (?) mapper graphs for input data such as a discrete metric space and a weighted graph.
